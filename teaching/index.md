I am a strong believer in open-learning, and so I've placed most of my teaching material online.

These three classes cover a statistical programming sequence:

- [R for Data Science I](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/)
- [R for Data Science II](https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/)
- [Advanced R](https://dcgerard.github.io/advancedr/)

These three classes cover an introductory Statistics sequence:

- [Introductory Statistics](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat234/)
- [Intermediate Statistics](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat614/)
- [Regression](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/)

The following contains some lecture notes I created to present to my research group on genetic data analysis:

I have also mentored students in the past. I am particularly proud of my Master's students who wrote theses with me:

- Sun, R. (2020). Estimating preferential pairing in polyploids. *Master’s thesis*. American
University. p. 1–47. [auislandora:85274](https://hdl.handle.net/1961/auislandora:85274) \| [ProQuest:2436381968](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2436381968)
