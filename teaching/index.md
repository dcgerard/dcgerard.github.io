I am a strong believer in open-learning, and so I've placed most of my teaching material online.

These three classes cover a statistical programming sequence:

- [R for Data Science I](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_412_612/)
- [R for Data Science II](https://data-science-master.github.io/lectures/)
- [Advanced R](https://dcgerard.github.io/advancedr/)

These (four) classes cover an introductory Statistics sequence:

- [Introductory Statistics](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat234/)
- [Biostatistics](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_320/) or [Statistical Methods](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat614/)
- [Regression](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/)

The following contains some lecture notes I created to present to my research group on genetic data analysis:

- [Genetic Data Analysis](https://dcgerard.github.io/gda/)

I have also mentored students in the past. I am particularly proud of my Master's students who wrote theses with me:
