      Hello! My name is David and I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the
      University of Chicago, working under <a href =
      "http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/">Matthew Stephens</a>. I
      obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at the <a href =
      "https://www.stat.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>
      under <a href =
      "http://www.stat.washington.edu/people/pdhoff/">Peter
      Hoff</a>. My graduate work was on the statistical analysis of
      tensor data. I am currently interested in Bayesian applications
      for next-generation sequencing data. You can read more about it
      on my <a href="/research/">research</a> page. If you want to see
      any code associated with my research, check out
      my <a href="https://github.com/dcgerard">Github</a> page.
