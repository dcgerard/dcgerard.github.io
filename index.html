      Hello! My name is David and I'm an assistant professor in the
      Department of Mathematics and Statistics at American
      University. I like to build statistical methods to analyze
      genetic data, and I've been trending toward studying population
      genetics in recent years. Before my current position, I finished
      a postdoctoral scholarship at the University of Chicago, working
      under <a href = "http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/">Matthew
      Stephens</a>, where I studied hierarchical modeling approaches
      to analyze sequencing data. I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at
      the University of Washington under <a href =
      "https://pdhoff.github.io/">Peter Hoff</a>. My graduate work was
      on the statistical analysis of tensor data. You can read more
      about my work on my <a href="/research/">research</a> page. If
      you want to see any code associated with my research, check out
      my <a href="https://github.com/dcgerard">Github</a> page. I also
      publicly post all of my teaching materials, which you can find on
      my <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a> page.
