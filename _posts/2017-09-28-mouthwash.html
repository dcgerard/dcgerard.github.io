<p>I <a href="{{ site.url }}/research/2017/06/29/ruv.html">previously</a>
  introduced the problem of unobserved confounding in large scale gene
  expression analyses and mentioned a few methods that attempt to
  account such confounding. (You should check that out before reading further.)
  However, all of these confounder
  adjustment methods are somewhat classical in that they do not adapt
  to the distribution of the effects. There is a long history,
  starting with Stein, of showing that shrinkage and hierarchical
  modeling can greatly improve estimation and testing.
  In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxy029">Gerard and Stephens (2018)</a>,
  I adapted these hierarchical shrinkage methods to
  the problem of unobserved confounding.</p>


<p>One shrinkage approach (outside of the context of confounder
  adjustment) that my postdoctoral advisor recently developed is
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041">Adaptive SHrinkage (ASH)</a>.
  ASH works in the old normal means problem,
  suggesting that researchers, when there is one observed covariate,
  take estimates for the effects \(\mathbf{B}\) (and their corresponding standard errors,
  \(\hat{s}_i\)) from an ordinary least squares fit and then assume
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:norm.means}
  \hat{\mathbf{B}} = \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{e},\ \ \ e_{i} \sim N(0, \hat{s}_i^2),\
  \ \
  e_1,\ldots,e_p \text{ independent}.
  \end{align}
  Though the normal means problem shown above is old, ASH's
  innovation is to take a non-parameteric empirical Bayes approach to
  estimation. ASH assumes that the effects (the
  \(B_i\)'s) follow some unimodal distribution, then estimates this prior
  by maximum marginal likelihood.</p>


<p>Using simulations that satisfy ASH's independence assumption,
  ASH was shown to be more powerful and better
  calibrated than competing procedures. However, when there is
  unobserved confounding, ASH, like most other methods, can fail
  drastically. For my next project, I took the ideas from ASH and the
  confounder adjustment procedures and
  unified them into a powerful and well-calibrated approach that
  accounts for unobserved confounding. To describe this method, I note
  others have shown that many confounder adjustment procedures can be reduced to fitting
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:reduced.model}
  \hat{\mathbf{B}} = \mathbf{B} + \tilde{\mathbf{\alpha}}^{\intercal}\mathbf{z} +
  \mathbf{e},\ \ \  e_i \sim N(0, \hat{s}_i^2),
\end{align}
where \(\tilde{\mathbf{\alpha}}\) is a known term and
\(\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^q\) is unknown. To me, this
looks just like the normal means model with an
extra bias term (\(\tilde{\mathbf{\alpha}}^{\intercal}\mathbf{z}\)). This
immediately suggested a strategy to unite ASH with confounder
adjustment: (i) Place a unimodal prior over the effects (&agrave la ASH).  (ii) Estimate this unimodal prior <i>jointly</i> with \(\mathbf{z}\).
(iii) Return posterior summaries using this estimated unimodal
prior. As with all methods, there were many additional practical
issues that needed addressing (e.g. variance calibration, robustifying
the procedure, dealing with massive datasets), but the result was a
well-performing procedure that I think will be quite useful for the
scientific community (software available
