title: Equivariant Estimation
category: code
layout: default
description: Under the array normal model, these functions will use a non-informative prior over the space of Kronecker structured covariance matrices to find equivariant estimators that perform remarkably better than the maximum likelihood estimator.

<p>I've published some <code>R</code> code on <a href =
"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tensr/index.html">CRAN</a>
that will run a Gibbs sampler to draw from the posterior distribution
of the Kronecker structured covariance matrix in the array normal
model. This posterior is with respect to a (non-informative) prior
induced by the right Haar measure over a product group of lower
triangular matrices acting on the space of Kronecker structured
covariance matrices. For any invariant loss function, any Bayes rule
with respect to this prior will be the uniformly minimum risk
equivariant estimator (UMREE) with respect to that
loss. This <code>R</code> code will also calculate the UMREE under a
multiway generalization of Stein's loss. This estimator dominates the
maximum likelihood estimator uniformly over the over the entire
parameter space of Kronecker structured covariance matrices.</p>

<p>Also available is a function that will calculate a (randomized)
orthogonally invariant estimator of the Kronecker structured
covariance matrix. This estimator dominates the UMREE under the
product group of lower triangular matrices. Details of the methods may
be found in</p>
