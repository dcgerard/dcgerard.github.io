I put on [github](https://github.com/dcgerard/vicar) an R package for some of my ideas on removing unwanted variation.

Let
<br>
\\(Y = XB + ZA + E\\),
<br>
for
-   \* \\(Y\\) an \\(n\\) by \\(p\\) matrix of gene expression data with \\(n\\) samples and \\(p\\) genes,
-   \* \\(X\\) an \\(n\\) by \\(q\\) matrix of \\(q\\) covariates,
-   \* \\(B\\) a \\(q\\) by \\(p\\) matrix of unobserved coefficients for the observed covariates,
-   \* \\(Z\\) an \\(n\\) by \\(k\\) matrix of hidden confounders,
-   \* \\(A\\) a \\(k\\) by \\(p\\) matrix of hidden coefficients for the hidden confounders, and
-   \* \\(E\\) an \\(n\\) by \\(p\\) matrix of independent normal errors with column variances \\(s_1,\ldots,s_p\\).

Not accounting for the hidden covariates, \\(Z\\), can reduce power and
result in poor control of false discovery rate. The
[`vicar`](https://github.com/dcgerard/vicar) package provides a suite
of functions to adjust for hidden confounders, both when one has and
does not have access to control genes.

The functions `mouthwash` and `backwash` can adjust for hidden
confounding when one does not have access to control genes. They do so
via non-parametric empirical Bayes methods that use the powerful
methodology of
[Adaptive SHrinkage (Stephens 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041)
within the factor-augmented regression framework described in Wang et
al. (2015). `backwash` is a slightly more Bayesian version of
`mouthwash`. You can read about these methods in our
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxy029).

When one has control genes, there are many approaches to take. Such
methods include RUV2 (J. A. Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed 2012), RUV4
(J. Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob, and Speed 2013), and CATE (Wang et
al. 2015). This package adds to the field of confounder adjustment
with control genes by

1.  (1) Implementing a version of CATE that is calibrated using control genes similarly to the method in J. Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob, and Speed (2013). The function is called `vruv4`.
2.  (2) Introduces RUV3, a version of RUV that can be considered both RUV2 and RUV4. The function is called `ruv3`.
3.  (3) Introduces RUV-impute, a more general framework for accounting for hidden confounders in regression. The function is called `ruvimpute`
4.  (4) Introduces RUV-Bayes, a Bayesian version of RUV. The function is called `ruvb`.

Many of these ideas are described in [Gerard and Stephens (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08393).
