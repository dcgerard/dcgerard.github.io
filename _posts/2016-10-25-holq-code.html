title: The Incredible Higher-order LQ Decomposition
category: code
layout: default
description: These functions will calculate Tucker decompositions. These are tensor generalizations of common matrix decompositions, such as the SVD, the LQ, and the Polar decompositions. The higher-order LQ decomposition provides the maximum likelihood estimators from the array normal model. Also included is a function to run a likelihood ratio test in separable covariance models.

<p> I've published some <code>R</code> code on <a href =
"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tensr/index.html">CRAN</a>
that can be used to calculate the incredible higher-order LQ
decomposition (incredible HOLQ), the incredible singular value
decomposition (ISVD), and the incredible higher-order polar
decomposition (IHOP). The HOLQ can be used to (1) derive the maximum
likelihood estimates of the covariance matrices under the array normal
model, (2) run a likelihood ratio test in separable covariance models,
and (3) calculate AIC's and BIC's for separable covariance
models. There are also a few useful array and matrix functions. A
description of the methods can be found in: </p>
